# Script to attend my lectures on google meet

I was finding it very difficult and annoying to find the meet codes or links between all the posts on classroom. So quickly put together 
this small but very useful script to help me take directly to the meet join in screen.

## Dependencies
selenium

## Note:
If you want to use this script,
1. Find out what chrome version you use and download the relevant chromedriver and replace it with the one in directory.
2. Edit the creds.yaml(which contains credentials) and tt.yaml(which represents your time table).
3. These two are yaml files and relatively easy to edit (beware of indentation tho).
4. The codes in tt.yaml are directly linked to codes in creds.yaml so make sure they are same.
